# Lost Metadata Data Analysis

This project simulates a real-world data science challenge: analyzing and modeling a dataset with **no metadata or feature information**. The only known column is the `label`, and the objective is to explore, clean, and prepare the data for machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and structured a dataset with unknown column names and data types.
- Visualized patterns and feature relationships to guide analysis.
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers using cross-validation.
- Performed statistical significance testing to compare model performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas / NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- SciPy

## 📊 Outcome
Successfully transformed raw, undocumented data into actionable insights and predictive models — demonstrating practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning without prior schema knowledge.
